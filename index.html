  <p>Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad."
    <br>
    <br>
    Simplicity is key in coding, as the best code speaks for itself.
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>First, solve the problem. Then, write the code</p>
    <br>
  
   <p> Focus on understanding the issue before diving into the solution.</p>
  </p>

    The best error message is the one that never shows up. Write code that anticipates problems, not just reacts to them. A well-designed system prevents more bugs than it fixes." – Unknown

  <p>Happiness is a state of mind and has nothing to do with the external world

    <p>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. When we prioritize readability, we create sustainable and maintainable code." – Harold Abelson
